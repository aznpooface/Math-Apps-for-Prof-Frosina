# Math-Apps-for-Prof-Frosina
My math teacher Mrs.Frosina is an enthusiastic hands on teacher even during COVID (somehow). 
I showed her the console apps I made to assist myself with the homework she gave us, and she was very happy to see them.
These apps are absolutely awful. But when I was that new student, I was very proud to have created something.
